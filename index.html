            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Various lists of the Wonders of the World 
                have been compiled from antiquity to the present day, 
                to catalogue the world's most spectacular natural wonders 
                and manmade structures. 
                <br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list 
                of the most remarkable creations of classical antiquity;
                 it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers 
                 nd only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim. 
                 The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented
                  perfection and plenty, and because it was the number of the five planets
                   known anciently, plus the sun and moon.[1] Many similar lists have been made.
